# Fedora Minimal Workstation Setup

The basic script and workflow for my own Fedora 37+ Workstation setup. If your goal is not a bare-bones environment, don't use it.

## Special Tips

- Just for Fedora Workstation and my personal habits, but maybe you can adapt it to suit yourself.
- If you are using an [ASUS ROG series](https://rog.asus.com/) laptop, please refer to https://asus-linux.org/wiki/fedora-guide/ to complete the basic setup to ensure proper working.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo.

    ```bash
